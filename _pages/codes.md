1. [**Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (DIReCT)**](https://github.com/samlaihei/DIReCT) <br/>
**Samuel Lai** <br/>
Deep learning model for direct VLBI image reconstruction from closure terms using a vision transformer.
1. [**Black hole Accretion Disc Fitting (BADFit)**](https://github.com/samlaihei/BADFit) <br/>
**Samuel Lai** <br/>
Provides a Bayesian framework to model the large-scale multi-wavelength quasar spectral energy distribution with ray-traced thin and slim accretion
disc synthetic spectra in order to constrain black hole properties.

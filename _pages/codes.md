1. [**Black hole Accretion Disc Fitting (BADFit)**](https://github.com/samlaihei/BADFit) <br/>
**Samuel Lai** <br/>
Provides a Bayesian framework to model the large-scale multi-wavelength quasar spectral energy distribution with ray-traced thin and slim accretion
disc synthetic spectra in order to constrain black hole properties.
1. [**Python-based Quasar Spectral Fit (PyQSpecFit)**](https://github.com/samlaihei/PyQSpecFit) <br/>
**Samuel Lai** <br/>
Sensibly model emission features in rest-frame optical and ultraviolet quasar spectra using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

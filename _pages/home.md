Greetings, I'm an astrophysics PhD candidate working with [**A/Prof. Christian Wolf**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wolf-c) 
and [**Dr. Christopher Onken**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/onken-c) at the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics, 
based on Mt. Stromlo Observatory of Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. 

My research revolves around accretion onto compact objects, namely black holes and white dwarfs,
but my current focus is on moderately high-redshift ultraluminous quasars. 
This involves submitting proposals to collect spectroscopic observations and analysing the spectra 
to characterise the black hole and its extreme environment. 
I also have experience in fully three-dimensional self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations,
which attempt to model the accretion flow structure and magnetised dynamics around objects with strong gravitational fields. 
Working with such fluid models in tandem with general relativistic radiative transfer, 
we can predict both the integrated flux and spatially resolved image. 
Such codes are fully parallelised and run on powerful supercomputers.

For more about my research, visit the [**Research**][1] page or have a look at my [**CV**](/assets/docs/CV_Samuel_Lai.pdf).

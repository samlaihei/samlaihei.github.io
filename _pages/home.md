Greetings, I'm an astrophysics postdoctoral fellow working with [**Dr Nithyanandan Thyagarajan**](https://people.csiro.au/t/n/nithyanandan-thyagarajan), [**Dr Ivy Wong**](https://people.csiro.au/w/i/ivy-wong), [**A/Prof. Christian Wolf**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wolf-c),
and [**Dr. Christopher Onken**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/onken-c) at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation based in Kensington, Western Australia.

My research revolves around accretion onto compact objects, namely black holes and white dwarfs,
but my current focus is on moderately high-redshift ultraluminous quasars. 
This involves submitting proposals to collect spectroscopic observations and analysing the spectra 
to characterise the black hole and its extreme environment. 
I also have experience in fully three-dimensional self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations,
which attempt to model the accretion flow structure and magnetised dynamics around objects with strong gravitational fields. 
Working with such fluid models in tandem with general relativistic radiative transfer, 
we can predict both the integrated flux and spatially resolved image. 
Such codes are fully parallelised and run on powerful supercomputers.
My current research direction also heavily involves machine/deep learning to perform image reconstruction from
sparse very-long baseline interferometry uv-coverage.

Greetings, I'm an astrophysics postdoctoral fellow working with [**Dr. Nithyanandan Thyagarajan**](https://people.csiro.au/t/n/nithyanandan-thyagarajan), [**Dr. Ivy Wong**](https://people.csiro.au/w/i/ivy-wong), [**A/Prof. Christian Wolf**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/wolf-c),
and [**Dr. Christopher Onken**](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/onken-c) at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) based in Kensington, Western Australia.

My research is primiarily concerned with accretion around compact objects, namely black holes and white dwarfs.
The focus of my PhD thesis was on characterising the properties and demographics of moderately high-redshift ultraluminous quasars. 
This involved submitting proposals to collect spectroscopic observations and analysing the spectra 
to study the black hole and its extreme environment. 
As part of previous work, I also have experience in fully three-dimensional self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations,
which attempt to model the accretion flow structure and magnetised dynamics around objects with strong gravitational fields. 
Working with such fluid models in tandem with general relativistic radiative transfer, 
we can predict both the integrated flux and spatially resolved image. 
Nowadays, my research direction concerns deep learning closure invariants to perform image reconstruction under the constraints of
sparse very-long baseline radio interferometry aperture coverage. Effectively, I now study ways to directly observe the black hole image previously simulated by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and radiative transfer. 
I strongly believe in open-source research and often publish my data or code on publicly accessible [**github repositories**](https://github.com/samlaihei).

  title: "Deep Learning VLBI Image Reconstruction"
  excerpt: "We utilise advanced deep learning techniques to tackle the inverse problem of image reconstruction/deconvolution from sparsely sampled apertures characteristic of very-long baseling interferometry. Our results show that closure invariants, special calibration-independent interferometric quantities, can be leveraged to perform accurate and efficient hyperparameter-free image reconstruction."

  title: "Characterising Black Hole Properties"
  excerpt: "We use established methods to characterise black holes in new data. 
  We also compare established methods to the results from novel methods that we develop and are continuously testing.
  Through this research, we hope to better understand the unified model of active galactic nuclei and construct robust samples of
  well-characterised black holes to study their evolution and interaction with their host galaxies. We also focus on ultraluminous quasars
  at moderately high redshifts. Refer to [**PhD Thesis**](/assets/docs/PhD.pdf) for details."

#   title: "Quasar Broad-line Region Metallicity"
#   excerpt: "Using metallicity-sensitive emission-line ratios, we study the chemical abundance in the quasar broad-line region.
#   Illuminated by the bright light of the quasar, we study how the metallicity is sensitive to the black hole properties and to redshift.
#   We find that the broad-line region metallicity is super-solar even up to high redshifts, suggesting rapid enrichment scenarios in the early universe."

  title: "White Dwarfs with Infrared Excess"
  excerpt: "For this work, we study images of 300+ white dwarfs, where the images are obtained from
  Gemini Observatory North/South and Spitzer Space Telescope. By extracting photometry from the image data, we study
  white dwarfs with infrared excess indicative of an irradiated dust disc, which are formed by the tidal disruption of 
  extrasolar planetesimals."

  title: "Emission from Black Hole Event Horizon"
  excerpt: "This work uses fully three-dimensional and self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation fluid models with general-relativistic radiative transfer 
  to explore how the inclusion of non-thermal component to the synchrotron emissivity in the accretion sheath defined by the hydrodynamical Bernoulli parameter can result in observable large-scale jet emission
  in the synthetic image. 
  Refer to [**MSc Thesis**](/assets/docs/GRRT.pdf) for more details."

  title: "General Relativistic Radiative Transfer - Black Hole Shadows"
  excerpt: "This work uses general relativistic radiative transfer inverse ray-tracing to investigate how the shape of the black hole shadow can reveal information about the black hole spin and observed orientation.
  See [**research essay**](/assets/docs/BH_Shadows.pdf) for more details."

  title: "Gravitational Wave Orbital Decay"
  excerpt: "In this report, we numerically estimate the orbital decay of two bodies in a close binary system due to gravitational waves.
  This result is consistent with the observed decay rate of a binary pulsar system. We also study the effect further through Fourier decomposition and separating by orbital eccentricity.
  See [**report**](/assets/docs/CUHK_report.pdf) for more details."
